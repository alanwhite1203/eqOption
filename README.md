# eqOption
Equity options, which are the most common type of equity derivatives, give an investor the right but not the obligation to buy a call or sell a put at a set strike price prior to the contractâ€™s expiry date. Equity options are derivatives that means their value is derived from the value of an underlying equity. Investors and traders can use equity options to take a long or short position in a stock without actually buying or shorting the stock. This is advantageous because taking a position with options allows the investor/trader more leverage in that the amount of capital needed is much less than a similar outright long or short position on margin. Investors/traders can therefore profit more from a price movement in the underlying stock.
